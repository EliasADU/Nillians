who was sent to the stars
whom I crushed for daring to be in the way
whose band will quickly forget
who shattered against my steel
who spoke [PRO_POS] last
whom I obliterated
whom I reduced to my height
an eggshell beneath my feet
who will find no more truths
whose life was not [PRO_POS] to waste
whose steel has joined my tapestry
whom I returned to the band in pieces
